Bean There ☕️

A café rating web app we’re building with React + Tailwind CSS.

Bean There is our little project where we can keep track of the cafés we visit together. Each spot can have:
	•	📍 The café’s name, location, links, and images
	•	⭐ Ratings for things like taste, price, mood, and ambience
	•	✅ Checkboxes for details (WiFi, parking, outlets, work-friendly)
	•	📝 Our own notes and opinions

It’s basically our shared coffee journal — a fun way to capture our experiences and memories while exploring new spots.
